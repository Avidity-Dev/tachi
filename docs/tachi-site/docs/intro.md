# Introduction

Welcome to **tachi** - a CLI tool for generating GitHub Actions workflows.

## What is tachi?

tachi automates the creation of CI/CD pipelines for project deployments. It generates:

- ðŸ”§ **GitHub Actions workflows** for building, testing, and deploying your applications
- ðŸ“¦ **Azure Container Apps configurations** with proper resource allocation and scaling
- ðŸ“‹ **Setup documentation** with all required secrets and configuration steps

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ Multiple Deployment Strategies

Choose the deployment strategy that fits your project needs:

- **trunk-direct**: Simple deployment directly to production on merge
- **trunk-release**: Tag-based releases without staging
- **trunk-release-stage**: Full pipeline with staging environment

All strategies include dynamic PR environments for testing changes in isolation.

> **Note**: The current implementation supports deployment to Azure Container Apps. Support for Azure Functions and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is on the roadmap.

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to get started:

```yaml
# tachi.yaml
name: my-app
strategy: trunk-release-stage

azure:
  resource_group: rg-myapp
  registry: myappregistry
  location: eastus

services:
  - name: api
    port: 8080
    external: true
    cpu: 0.5
    memory: 1Gi
```

Run tachi to generate everything:

```bash
uvx tachi generate --config tachi.yaml
```

That's it! You now have complete GitHub Actions workflows and Azure configurations ready to deploy.
